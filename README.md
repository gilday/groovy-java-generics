groovy-java-generics
====================

Found a discrepancy between Java and Groovy when dealing with interfaces, generics, and inheritence. Need a solution

The Java project shows the inheritence pattern I'd like to accomplish in Groovy. The Groovy compiler does not support it. Is there a more "Groovy" way to accomplish this?
